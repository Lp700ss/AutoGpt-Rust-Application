AutoGPT Rust Application is a project designed to leverage the power of Rust for creating autonomous agents that can perform complex tasks, combining the strengths of the language's memory safety, high performance, and concurrency capabilities. This application follows the principles of AutoGPT, allowing for automated task planning and execution without direct user interaction, ideal for building AI-driven assistants, bots, or automation tools.

Key Features
Autonomous Agent Execution: Enables agents to make independent decisions and execute tasks based on user-defined goals and rules.
Rust-Powered Performance: High efficiency and low memory footprint with Rust's memory safety and zero-cost abstractions.
Concurrency and Async Support: Uses Rust's async capabilities and libraries like Tokio for handling multiple tasks concurrently.
Customizable Task Pipelines: Configure unique task flows and rules for each agent to ensure adaptability for varied use cases.
Secure and Robust: Leveraging Rust's strong typing system and error handling for stability and security, making the application reliable in production environments.
Installation
Ensure you have Rust installed.

Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/Lp700ss/AutoGpt-Rust-Application.git
cd AutoGpt-Rust-Application
Build the project:


cargo build --release
Run the application:



cargo run
Usage

Customize agent behavior through the configuration parameters, such as task priorities, dependencies, and execution rules.
Start the application to initiate agents based on the provided configurations.


Task Goals: Define the primary goals each agent should achieve.
Execution Strategy: Define the sequence and dependencies for tasks.
Concurrency Settings: Fine-tune agent parallelism for efficient resource management.
